# SDN Genetic Algorithm
This repository contains the algorithm used to generate SDNs (using genetic algorithms) that causes most test failures.
To set up an environment for TestOn on Ubuntu 18.04, the following [instructions](https://github.com/matin1520/sdn.genetic.algorithm/blob/master/documentation/Ubuntu%2018.04%20Local%20Setup.pdf) maybe used.

## Network validity criteria
### A network is considered to be valid while it respects the following criteria:
- Contains at least 1 switch node
- Contains at least 1 host node
- All nodes within a network are linked (connected) to another
- A switch cannot be connected to itself
- A host cannot be connected to another host
- Given a network of N nodes, there is a path (through links) to all N-1 nodes from any chosen node n within the network.

## Mutation
The mutation types of the algorithm is the followings:
- Add a switch
- Remove a switch
- Add a host
- Remove a host

Each mutation type has a configurable probability of happening. The configurations are stored in *app.config* file. Note that there is no add/remove links operation. This is done implicitely through the 4 mutation types. Every time a switch or a host is added, there will be N numbers of link generated for that node, where N is a random number between 1 and the maximum possible links. Similarly, every time a switch. or a host is removed, all its links are also removed.

## Fitness
The fitness formula will be based on how many of the executed tests have failed. However, there may be cases where not all of the tests execute. Therefore, we will be accounting the number of tests run into our fitness formula as well. We define the weight percentage for each part of the formula as alpha (Î±). This value can be changed from the Configuration if need be, with a default value of 0.5. The fitness will give 50% weight to the ratio of failed tests and 50% weight to the ratio of run tests.

## Configuration
### app.config file
This file consists of the following configurations (as of now):

#### alpha
This configuration sets the weight of each term of the fitness formula.
Value can be between 0.0 and 1.0

#### addSwitchProbability
This configuration sets the probability of adding a random switch to the network.
Value can be between 0.0 and 1.0

#### removeSwitchProbability
This configuration sets the probability of removing a random switch from the network.
Value can be between. 0.0 and 1.0

#### addHostProbability
This configuration sets the probability of adding a random host to the network.
Value can be between 0.0 and 1.0

#### removeHostProbability
This configuration sets the probability of removing a random host from the network.
Value can be between. 0.0 and 1.0

#### populationSize
This configuration sets the size of the population to be generated in the Genetic Algorithm

#### maxHostGenerationCount
This configuration sets the maximum number of hosts that can be generated for an individual network.
The number of hosts generated will be a random number between 1 and *maxHostGenerationCount*

#### maxSwitchGenerationCount
This configuration sets the maximum number of switches that can be generated for an individual network.
The number of switches generated will be a random number between 1 and *maxSwitchGenerationCount*

#### testOnTestPath
This configuration sets the absolute path to the TestON's test directory.
Example of value: /home/TestON/tests/SAMP/SAMPstartTemplate_1node

#### networkTopologyPath
This configuration sets the absolute path to the topology file to be modified.
Example of value: /home/OnosSystemTest/TestON/tests/SAMP/SAMPstartTemplate_1node/Dependency/newFuncTopo.py

#### hostIpsFilePath
This configuration sets the path to the file containing all possible host ips line by line.

#### selectionSize
This configuration sets the size of the offsprings for the next generation.
Example: if it is set to 4, the new generation will consist of 4 offsprings and 6 new individuals (assuming a population of size 10 of course)

#### tournamentK
This configuration sets the sensitivity of the tournament selection K.
Example: if it is set to 3, during selection, 3 individuals will be randomly selected from which the fittest individual is chosen.

#### generationNb
This configuration sets the number of generations the algorithm will run.
